## On OSX

 - Option + click your audio settings

 - Select Soundflower 2ch for both the Input and Output device. Now the audio that would normally come out of your speakers is going through your input device. You can test this by opening Quickplayer and selecting "New Audio Recording" in the File menu. You'll see the sound bars moving as if music is playing, even though you can't hear anything.
